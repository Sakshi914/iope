"We are aware that certain medicines are temperature sensitive and have certain specified maximum temperature. 
Now with temperature sensitive COVID vaccines, awareness of exposure to higher temperatures has become important. 
If the medicine is kept for certain period on a temperature higher than specified limits, the medicine is not recommended to be used. 
During transportation from production units to distributors/retailers etc and the consumers, chances are always there that the temperature exceeds the specified range and may not be recommended for use. 
As of now there is no mechanism to track the temperature range violation. 
Same can be applicable in food industry too. 
Safe Transfer is a software in which a sticker is designed for medicines and other dietary products which can change its colour with change in specified temperature (and duration of exposure to higher temperature),
it will be highly useful in maintaining quality of the various products. 
Major expectations from the device - Programmable in terms of temperature and exposure duration - Passive in terms of power requirement - Cost effective - Robust, temper proof"
